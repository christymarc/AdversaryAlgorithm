# CS159 Final Project

Final project for NLP Spring 2023. Implementing PWWS-esque algorithm for adversarial example generation of DNN sentiment analysis models.

## Notes
PWWS algorithm inspired by this paper [Generating Natural Language Adversarial Examples through Probability Weighted Word Saliency](https://aclanthology.org/P19-1103.pdf) by Ren, et al. DNNs trained and implemented through fastai, [the IMDB movie review dataset](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/).
